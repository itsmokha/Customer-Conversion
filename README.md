# Effect of promotional campaigns on customer conversion rate
This project aims to visualise and analyse the effect of promotions on customer conversion. 
From the graphs and matrices plotted, we can see that customer conversion is highest in suburban areas, and among users who have used discounts previously.
Furthermore, the conversion rate was highest in users who received discounts, compared to users receiving 'Buy one get one' offers, and among web users compared to mobile users.
The conversion rate was also higher in users who had used the platform within the past 2 months.
