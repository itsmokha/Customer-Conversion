# Effect of promotional campaigns on customer conversion rate
Customer conversion rate is a metric used to identify the number of users who have bought products from a site compared to the total number of visitors to the site. Tracking marketing campaign conversion rates is essential to fine tune the marketing strategy, or even change it if it proves to be ineffective. It can also be used to identify the areas with the most conversions and areas with lesser conversions, allowing companies to identify focus groups and fine tune their advertising strategy.

# Aims
This project aims to visualise and analyse the effect of certain promotions on customer conversion. Using this information, the website can identify users with the most conversion potential and can understand the effects of different types of offers.

# Observations
From the graphs and matrices plotted, we can see that the conversion rate was highest in users who received discounts, compared to users receiving 'Buy one get one' offers, and among web users compared to mobile users.
The conversion rate was also higher in users who had used the platform within the past 2 months.
Furthermore, the customer conversion is highest in suburban areas, and among users who have used discounts previously.

# Future plan
- Uplift modeling: Identify customer behaviour from the data. This can be useful when identifying groups to target for promotions and marketing.
- Visualization using PowerBI: Visualise the data in PowerBI.
